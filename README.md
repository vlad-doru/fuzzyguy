Welcome to FuzzyGuy!	{#welcome}
=====================

**FuzzyGuy** is an open-source project aimed at creating a performant and
scalable service for fuzzy searching. The backend service may be extremely
useful to implement facilities such as *Did you mean* at a low cost.

Development
---------
**FuzzyGuy** repository consists of a back-end service developed mainly in *Go*,
which only uses *Python* to generate test files useful for benchmarking,
and a sample application developed in *Python* which interacts with the daemon
via a RESTful API.

Documentation
---------
Documentation about the service may be found in this project's wiki where you
can find how you can interact with the RESTful API and how to build and
run the project.
